                The game board size is 7x7. The triangle symbols are the pieces belonging to Player 1, who is AI-based. The circle symbols are the pieces belonging to Player 2, the human player. Each player has four pieces. When the game starts, Player 1 makes the first move. Pieces can move both horizontally and vertically. Diagonal movements are not allowed. If a player has more than one piece, they must make two consecutive moves with different pieces. If a player has only one piece, they can make only a single move.
